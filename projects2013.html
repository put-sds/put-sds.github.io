<h3>Projects being developed in 2012/2013</h3>
<div class="project"> 
<p class="project-title">eTAP</p>
<b>electronic Teaching Assignment Process (eTAP)</b> <br/>
<b>Context:</b> At a University teaching assignments are planned and distributed among tutors before the 
	beginning of each academic year. At the end of each semesters tutors need to confirm which 
	assignments they did.
<br/>
<b>Problem:</b> There are three main problems connected with teaching 
	assignments process, i.e., (1) assigning the courses to tutors, (2) notifying 
	tutors about assignments and changes, (3) tutors acceptance of planned and 
	confirmation about performed assignments.
<br/>
<b>Solution:</b> eTAP system should be a flexible (can be used by various faculties having various internal structures) system which allows for planning and 
	confirming teaching assignments.
</div>

<div class="project"> 
<p class="project-title">FIS </p> 
<b>Faculty Information System (FIS)</b> <br/>
<!--<b>Context:</b> 
<br/>-->
<b>Problem:</b> The management of faculty requires realizing certain strategies in order to 
	achieve the stated goals and monitoring their effects. Unfortunately there are numerous measures that need to be collected in order to satisfy the 
	management information needs. Currently, over 100 measures are identified and controlling them manually is impossible.
<br/>
<b>Solution:</b> FIS should support both data collection and analyses. Data 
	collection should be possible from different sources: external and internal databases and systems, and from information provided by people to the system. Data analyses should be 
	limited to generation of reports required by users.
</div>

<div class="project"> 
<p class="project-title">iQuest</p>
 <b>interactive Questionnaires (iQuest)</b> <br/>
<!-- <b>Context:</b>
<br/> -->
<b>Problem:</b> There are two major types of problems at a University which are connected with a need to recognize opinions on certain problem/issue. First,  each University needs to have a quality management system to improve the teaching process; one of the sources for problem 
	firing in teaching process is the opinion of students. Currently, there are hardcopy questionnaires distributed among students. Secondly,  each University is obliged to track the career paths of the graduates (e.g., have they managed to find job?, is the job connected with what they learned?).  
<br/>
<b>Solution:</b> iQuest system should allow for designing and carrying out online surveys among students and 
	alumnus. It should allow for quick, flexible and easy designing of surveys and generating various reports. The system is also to permit a respondent to access some materials (e.g., 
	articles, courses) after completing a survey.
</div>
<div class="project"> 
<p class="project-title">ROPS</p>
 <b>Registration and evaluation of curricula (ROPS) (pl: Rejestracja i ocena programów studiów)</b> <br/>
<b>Context:</b> Curriculum is the set of courses, and their content, offered at a university. Each course of study may have its own curriculum, even there is a possibility that a student (who realizes an individual study process) has their own 
	curriculum. However, each curriculum must fulfill the requirements of the Ministry of 
	Education. 
<br/>
<b>Problem:</b> Management of numerous curricula is a complex task. There are individual curricula, optional courses which need to be taken into account while 
	designing a curriculum. Moreover, each curriculum must conform to the Ministry requirements. Currently 
	curricula design is performed by hand.
<br/>
<b>Solution:</b> The ROPS system should allow for designing, verification, 
	parameter calculation of curricula. It should also support creation of educational effects for certain fields of studies and of educational effects matrixes.
</div>

<div class="project"> 
<p class="project-title">RPO</p>
 <b>Organizational assignments register (RPO) (pl: Rejestr prac organizacyjnych)</b> <br/>
<b>Context:</b> Generally, there are tree types of assignments for University 
	employees, i.e., research, educational and organizational.
<br/>
<b>Problem:</b> The time spent on educational duties is controlled by special units, the time spent on research should be maximized in order to maintain the 
	research character of a university. Unfortunately, organizational duties, e.g., organizing meetings, ordering some equipment, are forever 
	stealing time. Moreover, the distribution of organizational duties is not equal among university 
	employs and is not controlled.
<br/>
<b>Solution:</b> The RPO system should be a register for organizational duties of university employees. It should be dedicated for both: people who assign tasks and those who perform them. The time required to log the tasks should be minimal. There should be also a 
	board mechanism (assigner announces that there are certain tasks to perform and performers choose those they like the most). Each system user should be able to generate some reports, which would allow almost equal distribution of organizational tasks and would help in gratification.
</div>

<div class="project"> 
<p class="project-title">WOODy</p>
<b>Supporting organization of theses defenses (WOODy) (pl: Wspomaganie organizacji obron prac dyplomowych)</b> <br/>
<b>Context:</b> Each thesis defense need to be well documented - there are some formal requirements. Partially this is done by Dean Office employees, partially by members of 
	thesis defense committees.
<br/>
<b>Problem:</b> Filling-in the documents for thesis defense is a complex task. Frequently, many errors connected with wrong 
	interpretation of rules, constantly changing rules, complex formulas required to be calculated. Moreover, there 
	different hardcopy documents which require the same information, i.e., not only the data of to-be-graduates, but also reviews of theses.
<br/>
<b>Solution:</b> The process of organizing and performing theses defenses should be improved and WOODy system should support new process. It should support a Dean Office employees in preparing the required documents (forms) and 
	should allow the members of the committees to simply input the required data (without repetition). WOODy should also support documents generation for hardcopies.

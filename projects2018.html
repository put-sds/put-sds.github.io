<h3>Projects developed in 2017/2018</h3>

<div class="project"> 
<p class="project-title">ADS [PL]</p>
<b>ADS: Advertisement Distribution System</b> <br/>
<b>Context:</b> In different locations, e.g., shopping centres, dental clinics, advertisements are presented to people on many devices such as display screens, TVs, tablets.
<br/>
<b>Problem:</b>
Currently there exists no software that would allow to manage the presented advertisements.
<br/>
<b>Solution:</b> The solution was to create a tool which enables management (create, modify) of schedules for advertisements. The output schedule can be than distributed to different display devices. <br/>
The project was developed together with Forcom Sp. z o.o.

<div class="project"> 
<p class="project-title">SIoP [PL]</p>
<b>SIoP: Employees Information System (System Informacji o Pracownikach) </b> <br/>
<b>Context:</b>  Each year employees at Poznan University of Technology are evaluated to monitor their career and satisfy the Ministry regulations.
<br/>
<b>Problem:</b>
Unfortunately, there are many different aspects to report on an evaluation sheet, which takes considerable amount of time. Moreover, most of the information must be reported also to other systems during the year.
<br/>
<b>Solution:</b> 
The Dean of the Faculty of Computing proposed to create a system that would import the data from other systems and present the initially filled in evaluation sheet to an employee. Then, the employee would need only to verify the information, add some additional data and sign off the evaluation.

<div class="project"> 
<p class="project-title">FAS [ENG]</p>
<b>FAS: Flexible Award System</b> <br/>
<b>Context:</b>In many cases, award process is run by volunteers and has time constraints.
<br/>
<b>Problem:</b>  Unfortunately, many people forget the deadlines and both nominations and opinions are late or not come at all. A solution is to send out remainders. But it is an additional burden on the people running the award process (who are also quite busy). Moreover, quite a lot of information that is in the nomination form is then repeated in the reviews and endorsements what makes unnecessary burden on the reviewers and supporters.
<br/>
<b>Solution:</b>To make various award process more efficient, it would be nice to have a web service that would be (1) Flexible, i.e., capable of supporting a number of different awards (e.g. IFIP Felllow, IFIP Service Award, IFIP Silver Core, Distinguished Monograph Prize awarded by Polish Academy of Sciences etc.); (2) Proactive, i.e., capable to send out reminders according to a pre-defined schedule; 	Secure, i.e. the data contained in the system should be protected against their corruption. <br/>
The project was realized together with the IFIP organization.

<h3>Projects being developed in 2018/2019</h3>

<div class="project"> 
<p class="project-title">ConMan [PL]</p>
<b>ConMan: </b> <br/>
<b>Context: </b>  Modern manufacturing companies require the support of IT systems to manage and optimize their processes. The ComMan system, developed by <a href="http://mindseater.com">MindsEater </a>, is one of such systems and allows managing manufacturing processes including handling customers orders and supply chain.
<br/>
<b>Problem:</b> The ComMan system was about to be customized for a new customer  IBM PACK Ireneusz Mazur. The company manufactures cardboard boxes. Therefore, there was a need for implementing new features into ComMan that would allow optimizing the use of cardboard sheets during the production of boxes.
<br/>
<b>Solution:</b>  The SDS team was responsible for building a module allowing to optimize the use of material (cardboard sheets) while producing cardboard boxes. The solution uses the binary tree bin packing algorithm to position cardboard meshes on the sheets. It also provides a visual editor allowing users to plan the cuttings of the material. In addition to the optimization module, the team worked on customizing other modules of ComMan according to the requirements of the customer.

<div class="project"> 
<p class="project-title">MApU [PL]</p>
<b>MApU: Mobilna Aplikacja Urlopowa</b> <br/>
<b>Context:</b> In many organizaitons their business processes such as electronic document workflows are supported with specialized software systems. One of such systems is Luminum. It allows to mange leave requests, log working time etc. All the functions are accesible through internet browser.
<br/>
<b>Problem:</b>
Currently more and more people work remotly, use moblie devices such as smartphoes. However, moblie internet browsers do not allow to make use of all capabilities of mobile devices. For example secure authrization process or displaying the contents in a flexible way.
<br/>
<b>Solution:</b> The solution was to create a multiplatform mobile application (Android, iOS). It shall allow to submit and manage leave requests as well as log the time spent at work and it shall interoperate with Luminum. <br/>
The project was developed together with Technology.

<div class="project"> 
<p class="project-title">The Resistance [PL]</p>
<b>The Resistance: </b> <br/>
<b>Context:</b>  Keeping the memory of historical events and teaching new generations about them is an important social mission. One of the attractive means of providing information about historical events is to use them as themes of video games.
<br/>
<b>Problem:</b> There are no strategic video games concerning World War II events in Poland that would be accurate historically and could help to teach new generations about the heroic acts of the Polish Resistance during that time. 
<br/>
<b>Solution: </b>  The goal of the project was to develop a demo of a 3D turn-based strategic game documenting one of the famous actions that the Polish Resistance organized - the assassination of Franz Kutschera - an  SS and Police Leader in German-occupied Warsaw. The game is available on Android OS and iOS.

<div class="project"> 
<p class="project-title">CaPrI [PL]</p>
<b>CaPrI: Capstone Project Information</b> <br/>
<b>Context: </b>   Each year new proposals for Bachelor and Master thesis both for full- and part-time studies are announced by supervisors. Then, students select the one they would like to realize.
<br/>
<b>Problem:</b> Currently, the proposals are published online as an electronic document that is difficult to change, e.g., when a proposal is already selected and no longer available. Moreover, it is difficult to manage the number and the limists of proposals submitted by supervisors. 
<br/>
<b>Solution:</b>  The solution is a web application that allows to submit the required number of proposals by supervisors. It shall display to the students the available proposals.
